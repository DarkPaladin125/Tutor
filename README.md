# Project Tutor
A project sharing my experience with programming languages and concepts.

## Goal
The goal of this project is to share what I've learned from programming concepts and languages over the years. The project will contain codes and text files (and, if necessary, even more kinds of resources) explaining (at least, what I have understood from) most programming concepts and their programming languages implementation.

It will serve as the main repository for "Tópicos Avançados em Programação Orientada a Objetos - ICMC/USP - BCC 015". It will also serve as a library so that I (and many others) can look a specific concept and/or implementation up.

## Strcuture
To be defined.

## Supported Languages
- [ ] C++
- [ ] C#

## Legal stuff
You can clone this project, but cannot commit to it. As for its files, you can look them up and distribute them, as long as they aren't changed.
