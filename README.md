# Project Tutor
A project sharing my experience with programming languages and concepts.

## Goal
The goal of this project is to share what I've learned from programming concepts and languages over the years. The project will contain codes and text files (and, if necessary, even more kinds of resources) explaining (at least, what I have understood from) most programming concepts and their programming languages implementation.

It will serve as the main repository for "Tópicos Avançados em Programação Orientada a Objetos - ICMC/USP - BCC 015". It will also serve as a library so that I (and many others) can look a specific concept and/or implementation up.

This is a not a project for learning how to program from the scratch, but rather a project to make programming concepts cleaner for those who already have some idea on what they are and want to learn more about a specific concept, learn more specific concepts and/or see implementation examples of them.

## Strcuture
To be defined.

## Supported Languages
1. C++ (version 11)
2. C# (version 6)

## Legal stuff
You can clone this project, but cannot commit to it. As for its files, you can look them up and distribute them, as long as they aren't changed.
