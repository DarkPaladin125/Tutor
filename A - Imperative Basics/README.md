# Section A - Imperative Basics

## Goal
This section will cover most languages basic aspects, the ones related to the Imperative Programming Paradigm.

It's worth noting that most people think Imperative Programming is the paradigm used in the C language, which is based upon functions, procedures and structures. That is partially true.

Imperative Prorgamming is a programming paradigm in which the programmer gives explicit orders to the computer. It has some "sub-paradigms", mainly Procedural Programming and Object Oriented Programming. It's opposite would be the Declarative Paradigm (languages like SQL, Prolog, among others).

Procedural Programming is the paradigm that is based upon procedures (and functions). This is C language paradigm.

The focus of this project is on Object Oriented Programming. However, if one is to learn a programming language, he/she must learn its basics. This section covers those basics.

## Structure
This section has lots of directories, each one will cover a specific set of (related) topics. In each of these dierectories, there will be README.md file, which gives a brief explanation of the covered topics. Along with it, you will find many source code files with examples of the covered topics.

## Covered Languages
1. C++ (version 11)
2. C# (version 6)
3. VB.NET (version 14)

## Status
<span style="color:red"">On hold, otherwise I will never start covering Section B, which is more urgent for my USP's social work.</span>
