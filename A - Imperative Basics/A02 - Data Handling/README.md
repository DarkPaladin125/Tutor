### Variables
Variables are the main storage unit of a program. To store data, you must put it into a variable. A variable will always have an identifier, a value and a type.

### Constants
Constants are like variables, except that they can only be read from and never written to.

### Literals
Literals are hard-coded constants that do not need to have an identifier associated. For instance, when you assign zero by doing `x = 0` (considering the `=` to be the assignment operator), `0` is a literal constant.

### Data Types
Every variable or constant (be named or literal) has a type, to give the computer an understanding of how the bytes stored should be interpreted. Among the basic data types are:

- Integral (integer) types, which can hold integer numbers;
- Among the integral types, there is the boolean type, which can hold a `true` or `false` value;
- Floating-point types, which can hold real numbers;
- Text types which store text, mainly characters and strings;
- Pointers, which can store memory addresses;
- Many object-oriented languages will also have an object type, which is the root of the language's class hierarchy (everything is object).

### Type inference
Type inference is the process of discovering the type of an expression. Some languages support type inference in a way such that you can declare a variable whose type is to be inferenced; when you assign to it, it will have type of the expression being assigned.

### Dynamic typing
A variable that has dynamic typing will not have a type on its own. But rather, its type will be the type of the expression it holds. This allows a variable storing a number to store a string later on, depending on what it is assigned. It's the opposite of static typing.

### Conversions
Conversion (or cast) is an operation that convert an expression from one data type to another.
