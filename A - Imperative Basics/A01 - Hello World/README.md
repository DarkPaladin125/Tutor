## Covered Topics
- How to write your first program: "Hello, world!";

## Theory Section

### Comments
Comments are pieces of code that your compiler (I will be using the word compiler, but I can be referring to an actual compiler, or interpreter, or even assembler) will ignore. You can write anything you want in a comment.

### Entry point
The entry point of a code is the part that is executed when the code is going to be run.
