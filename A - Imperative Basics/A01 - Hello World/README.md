# A01 - Hello World

## Covered Topics
- How to write your first program: "Hello, world!";
- Comments.

## Theory Section
Comments are pieces of code that your compiler (I will be using the word compiler, but I can be referring to an actual compiler, or interpreter, or even assembler) will ignore. You can write anything you want in a comment.
